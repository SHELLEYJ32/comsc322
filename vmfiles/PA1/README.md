# Programming Assignment 1

This assignment helps build your familiarity with C.  The full project
description is on Moodle, but in brief...

It has three parts:
 * `sizes` looks at the sizes of various C types
 * `tokenize` looks a bit at C strings
 * `cards` requires structs and arrays

There are C files for each part included, though they currently don't do
anything!

There's also a Makefile included.  You can do `make sizes` to compile the
`sizes` program.  You can do `make test_sizes` to run some tests similar to
ones that will be used for grading.  There are variants of the above for the
other two parts as well.  Additionally, `make all` (or just `make`) makes
everything, and `make tests` will make and test everything (it may be wise
to run this before submitting!).

Good luck!
